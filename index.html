                    <p>'Head of a Skeleton with a Burning Cigarette' is a painting I like. This painting was made by Vincent van Gogh in early 1886. I like this painting because of the strong dramatic contrasts and the accurate anatomy of the skeleton.</p>

                    <p>'Still-Life of Flowers with a Fritillary in a Stone Niche' is a painting I like. This painting was made by Jacob Woutersz Vosmaer around 1613. I like this painting because of the dramatic contrasts, vibrant colours and because the longer you look the more little details you see.</p>
